# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project implements a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset. The model is designed to accurately classify transactions as "Normal" or "Fraud" while managing the inherent class imbalance in the dataset.

## Problem Statement

Credit card fraud is a significant issue for financial institutions. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can detect fraudulent transactions effectively, minimizing both false positives (normal transactions flagged as fraud) and false negatives (fraudulent transactions classified as normal).

## Dataset

- The dataset used for this project contains credit card transaction data with anonymized features to protect customer privacy.
- It includes labeled transactions, where `Class = 0` indicates a normal transaction and `Class = 1` indicates a fraudulent transaction.
- Due to the imbalance in the dataset (fraudulent cases are rare), special techniques were applied to balance the classes.

## Data Preprocessing

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Any missing values were handled either by imputation or removal.
2. **Feature Scaling**: Features were standardized to improve model performance and training stability.
3. **Addressing Class Imbalance**: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied to balance the classes, generating synthetic samples for fraudulent transactions.

## Feature Engineering

Since the dataset's features are anonymized, minimal feature engineering was performed. We focused on using the given features effectively, potentially applying dimensionality reduction methods (like PCA) as an optional step.

## Model Selection

We tested various models and selected **Random Forest Classifier** for the final implementation due to its performance and ability to handle class imbalance effectively. 

### Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameters such as `n_estimators` and `max_depth` were optimized to improve model performance, especially in minimizing false negatives and maintaining high recall.

## Evaluation Metrics

The model was evaluated based on:
- **Precision**: The ratio of correctly predicted fraud cases to the total predicted fraud cases.
- **Recall**: The ratio of correctly predicted fraud cases to the total actual fraud cases.
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A normalized confusion matrix was used to visually inspect the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

## Results

The Random Forest model achieved the following results on the test set:
- **High Recall for Fraud Cases**: Successfully detected ~94.51% of fraudulent transactions.
- **Low False Positive Rate**: Only ~3.41% of normal transactions were misclassified as fraud.
- **Balanced Performance**: The model provides a good balance between detecting fraud and minimizing false alarms, making it suitable for production.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit_card_fraud_detection.git
   cd credit_card_fraud_detection
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Install the required Python packages using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Launch Jupyter Notebook to view the analysis and model-building process:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb
   ```

4. **Train and Evaluate Model**:
   Run the code in the notebook or `src/train_model.py` (if available) to train and evaluate the model on the dataset.

## Conclusions

The Random Forest model with SMOTE balancing is effective at detecting fraudulent transactions in an imbalanced dataset, achieving high recall and precision for fraud cases. The model is well-suited for production deployment with continuous monitoring and retraining as new data becomes available.

## Future Work

- **Further Model Tuning**: Additional hyperparameter tuning or more complex ensemble methods could be explored to improve performance.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Consider implementing this model in a real-time environment, using streaming data for fraud detection.
- **Additional Features**: Further research could uncover more informative features, potentially enhancing the model's accuracy and robustness.
